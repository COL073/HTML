                <p>I am a passionate individual with a strong interest in web development.I am currently pursuing my degree, Bachelor of Education Science in the University of Nairobi.My interest for web development was sparked by the movies i used to watch while young and it continued growing with time.Curiosity killed the cat they say but in this case I'm hoping my curiosity will better both my life and those of others.</p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>Here are some of my projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Baking: Just like web development, growing up I was fascinated by both chefs and bakers.With time I managed to convince my caregivers and started practicing.So far I can bake three types of cakes(vanilla,banana and spongecakes)

                    </li>
                    <li>Mental health:After an incident that happened to me I realised people deem therapy as well as guidance and counselling as wastage of money. How can someone 'fix'you? So after helping myself out and standing on my two feet I started researching on mental health and affordable therapists in Kenya. I am part of an organisation in school that offer such sessions free of charge then refer the patients for further medication if it is beyond our capability.</li>
